    <!--    The NgFor directive instantiates a template once per item from an iterable.
            The context for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context
            with the given loop variable set to the current item from the iterable.

            NgFor is a repeater directive â€” a way to customize data display.

            Our goal is to present a list of items. We define a block of HTML that
            defines how a single item should be displayed. We tell Angular to use
            that block as a template for rendering each item in the list.

    <div *ngIf="officeIsOpen">
        Our office is currently open, give us a call now.

    <div *ngIf="!officeIsOpen">
        Our office is closed at the moment, but we'll be open again soon.
